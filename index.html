  <p>Imagine a world without computers that suddenly has computers. That is what this website will do for you. Starting back in nam, the team orignated off a typewriter coding for Southern Vietnamize faction as they fought the northern opressors. Fearing for their lives, Jack and Ryan managed to escape the country to the United States. Meeting a poor child on the road, they told him to follow his dreams of coding. That child is </b>Bill Gates</b>. Thats right, we created Bill Gates. You're welcome. </p>

  <li>Ryan: I am a computer genie. Whatever I do happens on a computer. Genie.</li>
  <li>Jack: Who is he? Nobody really knows. The only thing that anyone is sure about is that he was born with a keyboard and a mouse in his hands. Born to code, lives to program Jack is a puppet master with computers.</li>
